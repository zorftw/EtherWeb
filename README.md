# EtherWeb
Website of Ether, I wrote this quite a while ago and it's one of the better WebDevelopment examples I have (working back-end stuff) so I thought I might as well make this public to up my resume a tad bit more.
Might rewrite something like this in C++ but I'm still not sure how I would provide dynamic implementations of stuff that wouldn't ruin compilation time completely.

Regardless, since this code is 12 months old already, don't take it as a testament of my coding prowess. Also I'm pretty sure Rocket-rs is outdated so don't use it!
